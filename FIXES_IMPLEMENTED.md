- **Industry-standard thresholds** for evaluation

---

## üìä How Calculations Work Now

### Equity-Only Metrics
These metrics are calculated using **only** equity positions (excludes SWVXX and other cash):

- **Volatility** - Standard deviation of equity returns only
- **Sharpe Ratio** - Risk-adjusted return of equities
- **Sortino Ratio** - Downside risk of equities
- **Beta** - Market correlation of equities only
- **Max Drawdown** - Largest decline in equity value
- **Win Rate** - % of profitable equity positions
- **Treynor, Calmar, Omega Ratios** - All based on equity performance

### Portfolio-Wide Metrics
These metrics include all positions (equities + cash):

- **Total Value** - Sum of all position values
- **Total Gain/Loss** - Combined performance
- **Concentration** - Top holdings as % of portfolio
- **Sector Allocation** - Distribution across sectors

### Money Market Fund Treatment
- **SWVXX and similar funds:**
  - Not included in volatility calculations
  - Beta set to 0 (no market correlation)
  - Expected return = risk-free rate (~5%)
  - Shown in "Cash & Money Market" sector
  - Contributes to total portfolio value
  - Not counted in Win Rate or equity metrics

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Test with Your Portfolio
1. **Upload your portfolio** - Include SWVXX to test money market handling
2. **Check sector allocation** - SWVXX should show as "Cash & Money Market"
3. **Review validation warnings** - Should see any data quality issues
4. **Try different timeframes** - Switch between 3M, 6M, 1Y, 3Y
5. **Verify metrics** - Compare with your broker's calculations

### Expected Behavior
- **SWVXX:** Beta = 0, no volatility contribution, labeled as cash
- **Equity positions:** Normal risk metrics calculated
- **Warnings:** If data is incomplete or metrics are extreme
- **Timeframe changes:** Metrics recalculate immediately
